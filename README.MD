Code Snippet’s in VS2005 and 2008 are a wonderfull tool that can decrease the time you dispend with coding. IntelliSense Code Snippets are reusable, task-oriented blocks of code. It includes code snippets covering tasks ranging from creating a custom exception, to sending an e-mail message, to drawing a circle. A set of Visual Basic and Visual C# Code Snippets are included with VS2005 and 2008 and there are additional Code Snippets that you can download and importo to VS.

Writting your own Snippet’s can be a hard work, especially if you using C#. There is a tool available at CodePlex called Snippy that is a Visual Studio Code Snippet Editor. It was designed to work with VS2005 but i tested in VS2008 and it’s working. With this tool, creating a Snippet it’s very simple. If you write your own Code Snippet or want to write this is the right tool for you. I recommended!

You can download Snippy from  http://www.codeplex.com/snippy/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=9316.

To use Snippy you have to compile it in VS because there’s only the source code available to download.

Download it, compile it, give it a try… you won’t regret it!
